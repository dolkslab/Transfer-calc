# Transfer-calc
Advanced transfer calculator project.
-------------------------------------------------
For now i have only made one JAR-file, wich calculates the angle that planets need to be in to make a transfer.
I hope to update it and add more features.
You can run it just like any JAR file, just rememember to mark it as executable on linux.
