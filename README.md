# Transfer-calc
Advanced transfer calculator project.
-------------------------------------------------
For now i have only made one JAR-file, wich calculates the angle that planets need to be in to make a transfer.
I hope to update it and add more features.
Also, im trying to learn java, so my code might be a bit bad, so be prepared.
You can run it just like any JAR file, just rememember to mark it as executable on linux.

# Htac.jar
Hohmann transfer angle calculator.
--------------------------------------------------
To use, run the JAR-file, with java 7 or newer.
Choose a planet you want to go from and one to go to, then click the button with "Calculate".
Should be fairly obvious.
Also i should inculde poor Pluto.
